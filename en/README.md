# Poppy project documentation

Welcome to the manual of the [Poppy Project](https://www.poppy-project.org/), an open-source robotic platform.

The documentation is organized as follow:
* [Getting Started](getting-started/README.md): an overview on how we use assembled Poppy robots and what we can do with them
* [Assembly guides](assembly-guides/README.md): probably the next section to read if you are looking forward to assembling your new robot!
* [Installation](installation/README.md): deeper look at the software, to see how it can be used in all possible usecases
* [Programming](programming/README.md): deeper look at the programming languages compatible with Poppy robots and their APIs
